## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### Continued development

i am feeling confident with hmtl5 markup, and css most common used styles, like shadows and laying out my plans for how to look of the page either single or multiple pages.

further development would be javascript or maybe python for the backend to setup my own server


### Useful resources

- [css tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - clear explaining of concepts including examples i will be using the for futher reference.
- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org) - probably the standard website for finding concepts i still not understand if is not found on any other sites I'd recommend it to anyone still learning certain concepts
